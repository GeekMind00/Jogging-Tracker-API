# Jogging Tracker API

## About The Project
> Jogging-Tracker-API is a RESTful API that tracks jogging times of users.

## Functionality requirements:
- Authentication: Create account / login / logout.
- When logged in, a user can view, edit and delete entered `jogging times`.
- Implement three roles with different permission levels: a regular `user` would only be able to CRUD on their owned records, a `moderator` would be able to CRUD users, and an `admin` would be able to CRUD all records and users.
- Each time entry when entered has a date, distance, and time.
- Filter by dates from-to.
- Report on average speed & distance per week.
## Built with
- Main project [RoR](https://rubyonrails.org/)
- Authentication [Devise](https://github.com/heartcombo/devise) 
- Authorization [Pundit](https://github.com/varvet/pundit)
